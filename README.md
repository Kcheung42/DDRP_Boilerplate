# A Boilerplate Example for a Dockerized Django/ReactJS web application with Postgres database

## This is an example project using the following technologies:
* Docker with Docker Compose
* Django REST APIs
* ReactJS
* Webpack module bundler and Hot Reloading (Hot Reloader 3)

# Setup Local Environment

1. Create .env file
2. make docker-build-dev
3. make docker-up-dev

#### Visit http://localhost:8000
 
## Babel
Javascript has versions named ECMAScript (ES). Allows us to have a clean, maintainable code using the latest JS specifications without needing to worry about browser support.

## Webpack

## Why Django + React

1. Turn your site into a single page web app. Faster.
2. Use the same codebase for iOS and Android (with React Native)
3. Manage complicated state more easily
4. React is Backend Agnostic
